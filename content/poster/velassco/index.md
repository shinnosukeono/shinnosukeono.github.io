**Location:** Nürnberg, germany

VELaSSCo (Visual Analysis for Extremely Large-Scale Scientific Computing) is an EC FP7 project involving a consortium of seven European partners. 
VELaSSCo aims to provide new visual analysis methods for large-scale simulations serving the petabyte era. 

The main output of the project is the VELaSSCo platform which has been designed and developed to perform distributed post-processing and visualisation of the results of very large engineering simulations.
